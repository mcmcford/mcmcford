Hey! I'm mcmcford and i started to learn to code back in 2019,
i have mainly worked in java but i've just started to branch out to python and C++.
Everything you see here will likely be terrible since i've only really been making
my random tests public (the code that i'm learning) but hopefully overtime, this
will start to look a lot better!
